# 🧠 Image Classification with PyTorch

This project is a simple image classification pipeline using PyTorch, built as part of my machine learning learning journey.

## 🚀 What it does

The model takes labeled image data, processes it through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and learns to classify the images into categories. It uses a custom dataset loader, transforms the images, trains a CNN, and tracks training/validation accuracy and loss.

## 📚 What I’m Learning

This project is part of my effort to:

- Learn PyTorch basics and syntax
- Understand how CNNs work
- Implement custom datasets and DataLoaders
- Train and evaluate a model on real image data
- Track and plot performance metrics

I'm learning this from **Learn PyTorch and PyTorch Syntax** by **@OmarMAtef** — big thanks for the clear explanations!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
